So I'm only 12, I love coding and have signed up to [hackclub.com](https://hackclub.com/arcade/)
I'm going to add all my code's etc on here for this summers ' arcade '
My computing teacher and my family are realy supportive of my enjoying coding in python
I hope to learn more over this summer through this course while gaining some tech goodies along the way
